TWO DAYS AFTER THE FAILED HEIST:

Narrator: You're is barely asleep, spooning your guitar, curled up on a military-style sleeping mat in the center of a small office room. The desks and computer terminals surrounding them are mildewed and rotting, the linoleum of the walls peeling off in chunks. A soft haze of morning light peeks through the partially crumbled northside wall. Kalle unplugs his datawire from a grimy terminal.

Kalle: Perle, you awake?
    -> <i>roll over</i>
        <<jump startOne>>
    -> "I didn't sleep."

Kalle: Perle, get up. Look, I didn't sleep either. I was going through some of the data left on these old terminals, but there's nothing but tax reports.

Kalle: I saw a couple searchlights from some Advisors. We should go. Rodriguez is already outside.

 Kalle: Me neither. I was going through some of the data left on these old terminals, but there's nothing but tax reports.
 
 Kalle: Look, I saw some Advisors patrolling the area. We're pretty well hidden here, but we should probably get moving. Rod's already outside.

Narrator: Perle and Kalle pack their sleeping mats and cooking stove into their rucksacks, donning their gas masks and exiting the delapitated building from the west side. They push through a pile of broken glass and metal that was once a revolving door.

Narrator: The building Perle and Kalle exit from was a skyscraper long ago; only the first four floors are still intact, with the rest of the building sloughed off into a mountain of rebar and rubble to the east. The Great Wall is only a few blocks away, towering hundreds of feet above the carpet-bombed ruins of the Termina district of Talos Mega-City.
